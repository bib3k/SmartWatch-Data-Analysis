# SmartWatch-Data-Analysis
This repo uses smart watch pre cleaned dataset from kaggle to analyse patterns or trends. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit)

**About Dataset:**
     
This dataset generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Individual reports can be parsed by export session ID (column A) or timestamp (column B). Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences. (from : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit/data) 

I have mainly utilised Data relevant to users general activity. This includes Steps, Calorie, Date, Active, and Inactive data. I have  tried to showcase relations between Calories burnt and number of steps. Additionally, Workers Activity with respect to stage of active minutes (Eg Lightly Active, Highly Active, etc) are analysed.
